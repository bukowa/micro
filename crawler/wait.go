// This can happen when all urls of a webpage should be crawled.
// If crawlers did not process any requests or responses for an exceeded
// period of time and it means that crawlers should be stopped.
// After each 'tick' WaitUnknownTime checks len of responses and requests that crawlers made.
// If these numbers didn't change between 'tick', n is increased by 1, otherwise n is zeroed.
// When n equals `count` and channels of Response and Request are of len 0 - crawlers are stopped.
// It mean's all Response object have to be taken out from the Queue before Crawler can stop.
